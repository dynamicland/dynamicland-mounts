# Mount things

Each folder has the .pdf for the laser cutter and hopefully some instructions to inform you how to assemble the mounts.

# Mount technique
For mounting projectors you generally need
* square friend (Strut Channel Twist-Lock Nuts from Unistrut
* 1/4"-20 bolt, screwed in from the top
* magic arm (Manfrotto 244) + camera bracket
* in addition to whatever bolts you need to mount the projector to the laser cut piece.

The camera bracket has a bronze nut that fits a 1/4"-20 screw. There is also a 1/4"-20 screw (with a gray knob) built into the bracket. Most mounts Paula makes these days comes with a hole that you must thread (using the tap and die set) so that this gray knob screw can screw into the mount.

Paula's tips for mounting projectors to the ceiling:
1. Assemble the entire projector/camera bracket/magic arm/square friend assembly on the ground.
2. Use a bolt to screw the magic arm to the square friend, and _leave this attachment loose_ because that's how the square friend has room to compress itself into the unistrut.
3. After you've compressed the square friend into the unistrut, tighten everything. To tighten, I spin the projector/magic arm assembly counter-clockwise to tighten the connection from below and also use a screwdriver to tighten the bolt from above.
4. Now you can plug in all your cables and adjust the position of the projector via the magic arm knob.
